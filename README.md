# odin-kittens

Created for the Odin Project, spec is [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-kittens-api)

Experiment in setting up an API using Rails.

RESTful Kittens app with create, edit, delete, view index of kittens. While server is running, responds to API queries for the index of all cats (<http://localhost:3000/kittens>) and if individual cats (<http://localhost:3000/kittens/1>) in JSON format.

No formatting and very basic navigation.
